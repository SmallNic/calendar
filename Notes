Maybe users can send requests.
Request:
from_whom - integer/references user id
to_whom - integer/references user id
calendar - integer/references calendar id
accepted - boolean

And maybe User can have a new_cal_request attribute.
User:
new_cal_request: boolean

If User.new_cal_request,
  Search the to_whom field of all Request objects
  if there is a match,
    temporarily allow the user to see the calendar(?)
    Show the user that calendar
    Ask if the user would like to be a participant in that calendar
    If yes,
      create new entry in users_calendars table linking User to Calendar
    Else
      do not creat entry
